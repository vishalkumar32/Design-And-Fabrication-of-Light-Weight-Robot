# Introductions
  A robotic arm, is also called as an industrial robot, is often described as a "mechanical" arm. It is a device that functions like a human arm, with several joints that move along an axis or can rotate in certain directions. In fact, a few robot hands are anthropomorphized and try and mimic the precise actions of a human arm. In maximum cases, they're programmable and used to carry out unique tasks, maximum normally for manufacturing, manufacturing, and business applications. They may be small gadgets that carry out

# Uses 
In a manufacturing or machine tool shop, robots can automate a variety of repetitive tasks. Machine tending robots place workpieces inside machine tools and remove them once an operation is completed. Milling robots help CNC automation by allowing for automatic tool replacement and unsupervised operation
